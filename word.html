        Throughout history, there have been multiple occasions that have threatened much of humanity. These occasions
        are termed as
        'Global Catastrophic Risks' and some might even have the ability to permanently and drastically curtail
        humanity's potential.
        There are a multitude of such 'Global Catastrophic Risks' that can occur within our lifetime.
        <p>
          However, it doesn't mean we can't defend ourselves from these or prevent these from ever happening. In fact,
          there have already
          been measures taken to ensure that these catastrophes don't occur or have a minimal impact. We will go through
          some of these
          risks and talk about what has been done,or what can be done to prevent/reduce the impact of such events.

        In the past 2 years, every single nation on
        this planet has been impacted by COVID-19, and it has killed approximately 4.44 million
        people globably, and the number would continue to rise. However, this is nothing compared to past
        global catastrophes. As a percentage of population, COVID-19 has only killed around 0.0563% of
        population, which is nothing compared to the impact of the Black Plague, which wiped out around 30%-40%
        of the population which it affected.

        A pandemic is declared when a disease spreads across countries and continents, having more
        infectivity and lethality than a regular disease. In the modern era of hyper-connectivity,
        and faster travel times, it's easier than ever before for such diseases to spread. However,
        the disease needs to be contagious to be declared a pandemic. Eg: Cancer is not declared a
        pandemic because it is unable to transfer from one person to another.
        <p>
          Pandemics often lead to economic unstability, and a disruption in social wellbeing,
          brought in by the nature of the disease.

          By isoltating the infected individuals, and ensuring that people are social distancing to
          prevent further sperad of the disease, a community can aim to "glatten the curve". The
          term flatten the curve refers to decreasing the peak of the pandemic.
        <p>
          This is done to not put too much burden on the healthcare system by overwhelming them
          with new cases, but rather having the cases be spread out over a longer period of time,
          ensuring that addequete supplies and care is available for infected individuals.
        <p>
          Isolating and social distancing practices also help in breaking the chain of transmissions
          between an infected individual and a healthy person, shortening the length of
          the pandemic.

        <p>
          One of the most effective ways to stop a pandemic is through vaccines. Vaccines provide
          the body with a weakened version of the disease so the body can learn to fight the diseas,
          and be prepared to fight the actual disease.
        <p>
          However, some people might not be able to get vaccines due to a weakened immune system, or
          due to other medical condition(s). To ensure that these individuals don't get the disease,
          it is important that a community develops herd immunity. Herd immunity is developed when
          60-70% of a community has gained immunity (in our case, through vaccines), virtually eleminating
          the disease from the community and ensuring that those who cannot get vaccines are not impacted
          by the disease.

      Cosmic Threats
    </h1>
    <div class="flexRight">
      <div id="f4">
        Cosmic threats are some of the few catastrophes that humans have no direct control over. These cosmic
        events include, but are not limited to asteroid impacts, close encounters with a black hole, gamma
        ray bursts, etc. However, not all of these are equally likely.
        <p>
          An asteroid impact is the most likely cosmic threat. An asteroid bigger than 1-2km can have
          disastrous can be disastrous for the the planet and all species.

        Threats such as gamma ray bursts are highly unlikely to naturally point in the direction of our planet.
        However, if such a scenario plays out, the strong burst of energy will most likely strip off Earth's 
        ozone layer, completly destroying most life on the planet.
        <p>
          A likely cosmic threat that can occur anytime is a powerful solar flare, where areas of sun suddenly 
          increase in brightness, often ejecting highly energetic particles, and coronal masses. If these hit 
          Earth, they can trigger geomagnetic storms that can disable satelites, and cause massive
          electrical shutdowns all over the world, and with most of our population relying on electricty in 
          their day to day life, it will have drastic impact on them, especially the healthcare sector.

        <p>
          Since humans are not responsible for any cosmic event, and these event can happen at any random 
          time, it is extremely hard to prepare for such events. 
          <p>
            However, for events such as asteroid impacts, the best bet is to increase the fundings of research 
            agencies such as NASA, so that they have more resources to look into the night sky and search for
            any potential asteroid that might be on course towards our planet. 
            <p>
              One suggested method to prevent an asteroid impact after detection has been "Kinetic Impact". 
              This means hitting the asteroif with  a massive object such as a rocket, or possibly any near Earth, 
              to deter the asteroid from its course.
