        Throughout history, there have been multiple occasions that have threatened much of humanity. These occasions
        are termed as
        'Global Catastrophic Risks' and some might even have the ability to permanently and drastically curtail
        humanity's potential.
        There are a multitude of such 'Global Catastrophic Risks' that can occur within our lifetime.
        <p>
          However, it doesn't mean we can't defend ourselves from these or prevent these from ever happening. In fact,
          there have already
          been measures taken to ensure that these catastrophes don't occur or have a minimal impact. We will go through
          some of these
          risks and talk about what has been done,or what can be done to prevent/reduce the impact of such events.

        In the past 2 years, every single nation on
        this planet has been impacted by COVID-19, and it has killed approximately 4.44 million
        people globably, and the number would continue to rise. However, this is nothing compared to past
        global catastrophes. As a percentage of population, COVID-19 has only killed around 0.0563% of
        population, which is nothing compared to the impact of the Black Plague, which wiped out around 30%-40%
        of the population which it affected.

        A pandemic is declared when a disease spreads across countries and continents, having more
        infectivity and lethality than a regular disease. In the modern era of hyper-connectivity,
        and faster travel times, it's easier than ever before for such diseases to spread. However,
        the disease needs to be contagious to be declared a pandemic. Eg: Cancer is not declared a
        pandemic because it is unable to transfer from one person to another.
        <p>
          Pandemics often lead to economic unstability, and a disruption in social wellbeing, 
          brought in by the nature of the disease.

        <h2>Isolation</h2>

        <p>
          By isoltating the infected individuals, and ensuring that people are social distancing to 
          prevent further sperad of the disease, a community can aim to "glatten the curve". The 
          term flatten the curve refers to decreasing the peak of the pandemic. 
          <p>
            This is done to not put too much burden on the healthcare system by overwhelming them
            with new cases, but rather having the cases be spread out over a longer period of time, 
            ensuring that addequete supplies and care is available for infected individuals.
            <p>
              Isolating and social distancing practices also help in breaking the chain of transmissions
              between an infected individual and a healthy person, shortening the length of 
              the pandemic.

        <h2>Vaccination</h2>

        <p>
          One of the most effective ways to stop a pandemic is through vaccines. Vaccines provide
          the body with a weakened version of the disease so the body can learn to fight the diseas, 
          and be prepared to fight the actual disease.
          <p>
            However, some people might not be able to get vaccines due to a weakened immune system, or 
            due to other medical condition(s). To ensure that these individuals don't get the disease, 
            it is important that a community develops herd immunity. Herd immunity is developed when 
            60-70% of a community has gained immunity (in our case, through vaccines), virtually eleminating
            the disease from the community and ensuring that those who cannot get vaccines are not impacted 
            by the disease.
